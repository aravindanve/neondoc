The Stripe API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts
form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes,
authentication, and verbs.

You can use the Stripe API in test mode, which does not affect your live data or interact with the
banking networks.

The API key you use to authenticate the request determines whether the request is live
mode or test mode. The Stripe API differs for every account as we release new versions and tailor
functionality. These docs are customized to your version of the API and display your test key and test
data, which only you can see. Subscribe to Stripe's API announce mailing list for updates.
